
# Photon

This was my first React project. It is a search image website based of keywords. It was part of the final step on the selective process phase of my intership at ELO JÃºnior. We were a group of three, but one decided to leave. We had a week to learn the basic and build it. My parter took care of the design and I did most of the frontend. We used the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) to get the images with a keyword.

## Lessons Learned

This way my first time use git for version control, working at different branches with pull requests. It was my first time working with someone, an amazing experience that taught me about trust, communication, listening and organization skills.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aruadecarvalho/Photon.git
```

Start the server

```
